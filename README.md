## **🛠️ Defensive Recommendations**

**Immediate Actions**
- Credential rotation across all administrative accounts  
- Registry locks and multi-factor authentication for domains  
- Comprehensive forensic analysis of compromised infrastructure  
- Enhanced monitoring and DNS change detection  

**Strategic Defenses**
- Implement Zero-Trust Architecture  
- Decentralize critical infrastructure  
- Deploy AI-assisted threat detection systems  
- Migrate to quantum-resistant cryptography  

**Long-Term Resilience**
- Establish a National Cyber Range for continuous red-team exercises  
- Air-gap critical services for essential infrastructure  
- Build international cyber defense partnerships  
- Develop elite cybersecurity workforce programs

## **📡 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**

**Network**
- Defaced domains: `president.go.ke`, `health.go.ke`, `education.go.ke` and 40+ others  
- Router compromise and cloud hosting IPs  
- Certificate transparency anomalies and unexpected certificate renewals  

**Host**
- Web shells and modified `.htaccess` files  
- Unauthorized scheduled tasks and new services  
- Unusual admin account activity and SSH key additions  

**Behavioral**
- Simultaneous multi-server file modifications  
- DNS record changes outside maintenance windows  
- Mass credential usage across unrelated systems
